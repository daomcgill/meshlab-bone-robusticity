# Measuring Robusticity of 3D Bone Meshes
## Overview

This project seeks to standardize robusticity grading of various bones, by using 3D scanned meshes and principle curvature analysis. Currently, robusticity is being measured using sight, and comparison to a non-standardized range.

## Curvature Measurement

>**Curvature:** in mathematics, the rate of change of direction of a curve with respect to distance along the curve. At every point on a circle, the curvature is the reciprocal of the radius; for other curves (and straight lines, which can be regarded as circles of infinite radius), the curvature is the reciprocal of the radius of the circle that most closely conforms to the curve at the given point <br />
